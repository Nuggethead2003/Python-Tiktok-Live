# Python Tiktok Live
 
## What does it do?
- A simple software I made to connect my smart lights to anyones tiktok live.
- When they like the live, it turns off and on my lights.
- Different gifts change the color.

## How can I use it?
- First you must check if your smart lights are Tuya compatiable. Do a quick google search to find out!
- Next, install [tinytuya](https://pypi.org/project/tinytuya/). Follow the instructions on the pip install page and put in the information required in the tinytuya.json file. After that, run the python script and type in the username you want to check for on tiktok.
